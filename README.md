# Cesium for Godot

*100% WIP. Currently targeting Godot 4.1.*

Cesium for Godot brings the 3D geospatial ecosystem to Godot Engine. By combining a high-accuracy full-scale WGS84 globe, open APIs and open standards for spatial indexing such as 3D Tiles, and cloud-based real-world content from Cesium ion with Godot Engine, this project enables a new era of 3D geospatial software.

Other Cesium projects include:

- https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unreal/
- https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-unity/

## Project Goals

The project will borrow heavily from the approach taken in the Cesium for Unreal plugin, adapting the concepts to Godot's scenes, nodes and resources.
